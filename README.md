# Displayboard
This is the repository for my free time project. I developed the circuits to drive an DOGXL display with touchpanel from Electronic Assembly. It is driven by two Atmel microcontrollers. One ATtiny for the Touchpanel multiplexing and reading and one ATmega for driving the display itself (simple operating system, graphics driver).
The project is split into three parts
- Circuits, EAGLE files for the circuit board
- TPU, The touchpanel driver/firmware for the ATtiny
- GPU, The display driver/firmware (including a simple operating system) for the ATmega
